### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am currently working on some ideas for adding diagrams to Swift documentation and 
hoping to connect with anyone else working on similar ideas.

The main project is [swift-sequence-diagrams](https://github.com/nickmain/swift-sequence-diagrams) which
provides a way to create sequence diagrams using a DSL and previewing them in Xcode.
